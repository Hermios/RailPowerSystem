Mod to have electric trains
3 new items :
- electric train
- Power rail (Mandatory to make trains work on it with electricity)
- Rail electric pole : Interface to connect wires to the rails.

The rails conduct electricity, as well as wires. So, if you need to connect your circuit+electricity to an outpost, standard long poles are not required anymore. Just connect a rail pole at your electricity center, and anoter one at your outpost

Graphics : They are basically awful, as I am not a designer. If anyone has better pictures to offer, I am glad to take them.

Any suggestion as well as feedback is gratefully welcomed.
